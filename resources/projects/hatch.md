# Hatch - Connecting students, ideas, and investors.

[Hatch](http://astorino.scripts.mit.edu/hatch) is the first website I built! I built it 
as part of the [MIT 6.470 Web Programming Competition](http://web.mit.edu/6.470). I 
believed there were barriers in the MIT community preventing students interested 
in startups from forming potentially great teams, and further barriers which 
made it difficult for investors to find these talented students. I knew that 
awesome resources were available to MIT students, but I found them difficult to 
access. So, knowing that other MIT students feel the same way, I wanted to 
create a network and forum to culture entrepreneurship at MIT. I also badly 
wanted to create my first website. 
 
## Lessons Learned  
 
First, and most importantly, I learned that web development is awesome. I had 
programmed for a couple years before, and one of the things I loved about 
programming was having almost instantaneous feedback: as soon as I thought of an 
idea, I could implement it and get a result. Web programming took this to a 
whole new level. I had immediate visual feedback on a website!!! These were 
things that I interacted with and used for most of my conscious life, and seeing 
how changing a CSS value in Firebug immediately changed the page was awesome. 
 
This was also my first time not doing object oriented programming. All my 
previous experience had been with Java, and it was eye-opening to see how much 
could be done without having to create object containers for every action. Now, 
being my first web project, the code ended up being a mess of PHP spaghetti with 
jQuery meatballs, but it was an important step in realizing that object 
orientation isn't the only way to program. 
 
Another important lesson was learning, the hard way, that there comes a time 
when feature-pushing should stop and polishing should start. The competition was 
3 weeks of programming with a hard stop, and unfortunately I didn't manage time 
well enough near that stop. I had a vision of all the features I wanted to put 
in the site, and I thought with just a little more code the site would be able 
to get much closer to that vision. So, I kept trying to add features right up 
until we weren't allowed modify the code any more. Unfortunately, the last 
change I made broke the login system (forgot to change a single variable name!), 
so as soon as the judges tried to check out the site they were presented with a 
PHP error message. I realized that I should have just been focused on polishing 
the experience I had already built: the small benefit of the next added feature 
is not nearly worth the risk of breaking the existing functionality. To really 
drive that lesson home, at the awards ceremony I saw lots of websites that were 
inferior to unbroken Hatch getting $1000 cash prizes. I gained a lesson that 
applies to any presentation: it's more important to put time into making sure 
what has already been done is presented smoothly than to try and complete more 
substantial work. That lesson is painful for the builder inside of me, but it is 
true.
