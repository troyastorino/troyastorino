# Robotic Rings Gymnast

For [2.12 Intro to Robotics](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m2a.html#2.12), I
built a gymnastic rings robot with [Paulina Mustafa](http://www.paulinated.me),
Tom Watts, Melanie Alba, and Egor. I worked as the team leader (official title)
and software developer. You can see a video of
[our robot partially running on YouTube](http://youtu.be/J7nfvlJluvY).
Unfortunately our servos died during the final competition (lots of teams ended
up having servo failures with the servos we were given), and we didn't have a
video of our final routine, but you can at least see it partially going. Our
[code for running the robot is on GitHub](http://www.github.com/troyastorino/brass-rat-pack).
More writeup is coming soon, but for now check out
[Paulina's page](http://www.paulinated.me/#!/ringsrobot)
