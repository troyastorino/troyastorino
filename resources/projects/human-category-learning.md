# Modeling Human Category Learning with Particle Filters

For a
[9.66 Computational Cognitive Science](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m9b.html#9.660)
project, I built an experiment with
[Turner Bohlen](http://wwww.turnerbohlen.com) to test how well particle filters
model human category learning. There has been previous work done that showed
that particle filtered well matched the final categorizations that humans made
for a set of stimuli, but it didn't compare the particle filter's decisions to
human decisions on a move by move basis. The experiment we built is still up and
running; you can check it out [here](http://clusterer.troyastorino.com/friend).
You can also look at
[the code behind the experiment](http://www.github.com/turnerbohlen/human-gibbs),
or read [the brief paper](/papers/category-learning.pdf) we wrote on the project
and our results.
