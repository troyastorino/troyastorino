# Collabow - Brainstorm real-time with anyone anywhere.

I came up with the idea for collabow while trying to work on a pset (MIT speak
for homework) with a friend who was on the other side of the Charles river.  We
were videochatting, and I was trying to show my friend how I was approaching the
problem. I had drawn a diagram on paper, and was struggling to hold it so that
the webcam could properly view it, when I realized that what I was doing was
ridiculous. I owned an iPad, which could work very effectively as a digital
sketchpad, but I drawing my ideas with a pencil and then trying to take
pictures. Google Docs was great for working remotely and typing, but sketches
are the natural language of brainstorming. I couldn't find a product that did
what I wanted, so I decided I wanted to build it.

Andrew Dorne and I applied to the [StartLabs](www.startlabs.org) C2C program.
Along with [Paulina Mustafa](http://web.mit.edu/pmustafa/www/), we worked to
turn Collabow into product.
