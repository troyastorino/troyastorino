# Robotic Odor Localization

As a UROP for the
[Robust Robotics Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/) and as a student
taking the [AeroAstro](http://aeroastro.mit.edu/) Experimental Projects Sequence
[16.621](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m16b.html#16.621)-[16.622](http://studenmit.mit.edu/catalog/m16b.html#16.622)
I worked on a system for robotic odor localization with Mark Van de Loo. I'll probably include a more
detailed writeup on this page soon, but for now you can look at [our final report](/papers/robotic-odor-localization.pdf)
(there are a couple pretty pictures to look at).
