Hi, my name is Troy Astorino, welcome to my homepage!

This website exists for two different audiences: myself and the world. 
Keeping a record of what I've done forces me to reflect on my successes and 
mistakes in a structured way, and so enables me to learn and grow from my past. 
This record keeping is there for a similar reason: I have solved so many 
computing by finding solutions on various blogs around the internet, and I want 
to make sure I'm there for those people struggling like me. From another 
viewpoint, this website has to showcase what I've done so that when I apply for 
positions, it's here. So, please excuse the mixed presentation that content on 
site has. 

Now for a little about myself. I'm 21 years old, a senior at MIT trying to learn
how to build intelligence. I'm majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Physics,
and love programming in beautiful languages (_\*cough\*_
Clojure(http://clojure.org/) _\*cough\*_.) I'm living
[in Boston](https://maps.google.com/?q=282 Newbury St, #12A, Boston, MA 02116)
and loving it (although I did live in [Baker House](https://baker.mit.edu/) and
I do miss it). I love games, particularly sports: I play
[tennis for MIT](http://mitathletics.com/sports/m-tennis) and play pick-up
basketball whenever I can. I've also been [Crossfitting](http://crossfit.com/)
with one of my roommates, and it's awesome!
 
So, feel free to peruse, and if you want to chat, shoot me an email (link in the 
footer).
