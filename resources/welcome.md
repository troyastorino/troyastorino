Hi, I'm Troy. Welcome!

I'm exploring life by adventuring inside and out of the great city of San
Francisco. I'm a co-founder at [PicnicHeath](http://picnichealth.com). We're
empowering patients to gain control of medical care, starting with their medical
records. I'm always more than happy to talk about it, so if you're in the mood
for getting your ear talked off feel free to reach out.

I got technical (and life) training at MIT. Overall academic goal: learn
to build intelligence. Still working on it.

* discuss -- books, econ, physics, philosophy, tech, programming, world domination

* play -- basketball, tennis, CrossFit, music, beach, rock climbing, swing
dancing, Settlers

Enjoy yourself, and if you want to chat, shoot me an email (link in
footer).
