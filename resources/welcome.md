Hi, my name is Troy Astorino, welcome to my homepage! Here I keep a record of 
some of the things I've done, both for myself to reflect on and to show the wider 
world.  

Now for a little about myself. I'm 22 years old, a senior at MIT trying to learn 
how to build intelligence. I'm majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Physics, 
and love programming in beautiful languages (_\*cough\*_ 
[Clojure](http://clojure.org/) _\*cough\*_.) I'm living 
[in Boston](https://maps.google.com/?q=282 Newbury St, #12A, Boston, MA 02116)
and loving it. I love games, particularly sports: I play 
[tennis for MIT](http://mitathletics.com/sports/m-tennis) and play pick-up 
basketball whenever I can. I've also been [Crossfitting](http://crossfit.com/) 
with one of my roommates, and it's awesome!
 
So, feel free to peruse, and if you want to chat, shoot me an email (link in the 
footer).
