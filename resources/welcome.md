Hi, my name is Troy Astorino, and welcome to my homepage! Here I keep a record
of some of the things I've done, both for myself to reflect on and to show the
wider world.

Now for a little about myself. I'm 23 years old. I just graduated from MIT,
where I was studying how to build intelligence (sounds kinda pretentious but
also awesome at the same time). My formal courses of study were in Aerospace
Engineering, Physics, and Economics. I love programming in beautiful languages
(_\*cough\*_ [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) _\*cough\*_.)

I played [tennis for MIT](http://mitathletics.com/sports/m-tennis) while I was
there (yes, we do have sports). Post-college, I've gotten into rock climbing and
[CrossFit](http://crossfit.com/), which is fantastic. On the topic of fantastic
things, I've also been tricked into liking ballroom dance. I like to play pick-up
basketball from time to time. Really, I'm always down to play any sort of game,
and I'll generally try a little too hard to win.

I'm working to help patients interact with their healthcare via
[Picnic](http://picnichealth.com/site). We're doing some pretty cool stuff, and
I'm always happy to talk about it, so feel free to reach out.

Enjoy yourself, and if you want to chat, shoot me an email (link in the 
footer).
