Hi, my name is Troy, and welcome!

I'm a youngster slowly making the transition to adulthood in the wonderful city
of San Francisco. I'm working to help patients interact with their healthcare via
[Picnic](http://picnichealth.com/site). We're doing some pretty cool stuff, and
I'm always happy to talk about it, so feel free to reach out.

I got technical (and life) training at MIT. Overall academic goal: learn
to build intelligence. Still working on it.

* discuss -- books, econ, physics, philosophy, tech, programming, world domination

* play -- basketball, tennis, CrossFit, music, beach, rock climbing, swing
dancing, Settlers

Enjoy yourself, and if you want to chat, shoot me an email (link in
footer).
