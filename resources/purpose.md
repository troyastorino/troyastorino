Computers have revolutionized the world. We've been able to eliminate repetitive
and mundane information processing task by writing programs to do them for us. 
At first the tools necessary to automate these tasks were very expensive, and 
only available to very few. The PC revolution, of course, drove down costs and 
made this automating power available to everyone. The internet provided the 
greatest distribution channel of task automization, and has prompted the 
creation of tooling that enables millions of people to write programs to improve 
their, and other peoples', lives. 
 
Automating physical tasks does not have that same accessibility. Robotics is 
sill a domain that requires low level expert knowledge, and so has a very high 
barrier to entry. Because of this, we still don't see the massive proliferation 
of robots that science fiction has predicted time and time again. I want to make 
robotics application development as easy as internet application development.
