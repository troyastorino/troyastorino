Computers have revolutionized the world. We've been able to eliminate repetitive
and mundane information processing tasks by writing programs to do them for us.
At first the tools needed to automate these tasks were expensive and available
to very few. The personal computing revolution drove down costs and made the
prospect of automization available to nearly everyone. The internet has provided
an incredible distribution channel for services that take advantage of automated
tasks. The reach that the internet offers has prompted the creation of incredible
tooling, tooling that enables millions of people to write programs that improve
their, and other people's, lives.

Many critical services have yet to be transformed by computing. Formal education
is one area where this is true. The proliferation of informal learning
opportunities over the internet has hinted at the power of technology to improve
education. Many people have been pursuing innovative and promising approaches to
bring technology-enabled techniques to formal education, and I'm hopeful that
some of these approaches with take root. Healthcare is another industry that has
yet to be transformed by technology as much as has been hoped. Not for lack of
money and effort - many brilliant people have poured their hearts and souls into
improving healthcare, and many programs have thrown oodles of money at problems.
The massive complexity and inertia in the healthcare industry has made progress
more difficult. I hope, though, that the approach we're taking at
[PicnicHealth](http://picnichealth.com/site) lets us make a big difference.

Automation of physical tasks does not have that same accessibility. Robotics is
a domain that requires low-level expert knowledge, and thus has a high barrier
to entry. Because of this, we have yet to see the massive proliferation of
robots that science fiction has predicted time and time again. I want to make
robotic application development as easy as internet application development.
